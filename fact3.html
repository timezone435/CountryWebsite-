    <p> Denmark owns greenland, this means that canda has a border with Denmark even though they aren't remotly close to each other. 
        <br> Greenland became a possession of Denmark in 1380 when the Norwegian kingdom came under the Danish Crown. Nuuk is the largest city in GreenLand;<br> with a population of a little under 20,000 that is about a third of the population of greenland.
